# Tonality

A library for handling tonal pitch classes.

## Inspiration

Types and operations are influenced by Musescore's internal library.

## Alternatives

`pitch_calc` lets you convert between a number of different pitch
representations. However, it is not very flexible in how it handles
transpositions or enharmonics. Useful if you don't have to consider accurate
musical notation.
